# vault-courier-examples
Examples demonstrating various use cases of Vault Courier.

All examples here run Vault in -dev mode, which is designed for learning and experimentation. This mode provides a quick and easy way to explore Vault's features in a safe, local environment. Keep in mind that the Vault state resets each time you restart the server in dev mode, making it perfect for testing and trying things out before moving to a production setup.
